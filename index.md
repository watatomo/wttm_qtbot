## Regarding Quotes

For the sake of consistency, the bot follows a style guide. More details on my standards can be found on my [translation archive](https://watatomo.github.io/tl/about/#Personal-Style-Guide).

- American English, western name order
- Honorifics that have English equivalents are to be changed
- Appellations, location names, and the likes are localized or changed to its English equivalent if possible
- Official romanization is used if there is any
- No "smart" quotes or ellipses

### Disclaimer

Quotes are posted randomly and can be from any part of the school year, meaning some might sound a bit strange. However, both characters reconcile later on in *Phantom Thieves VS Detectives.* [@wttm_qtbot](https://twitter.com/wttm_qtbot) is made to showcase the various developments Tomoya and Wataru's relationship had throughout the timeline. That includes all the up and downs that occurred, as no relationship is "perfect." The bond they share is vital for both of their character arcs, and it will continue to grow in the *!!* era.
